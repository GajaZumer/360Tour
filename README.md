# Gamified 360° tour around Ljubljana castle:
* 6 locations,
* 2D signs pointing to the city's landmarks,
* animated 3D model of a knight,
* target shooting,
* video,
* an info point that sends a user to another url with more information about the castle.


The project is a prototype for making 360° tours in Unity and is used as teaching material in workshops for students who want to learn the basics of XR and Unity game engine.
